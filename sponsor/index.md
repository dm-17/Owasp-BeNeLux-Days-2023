## OWASP - Sponsorship OWASP BeNeLux Chapters and 2023 conference

<a href="/assets/files/OWASP_BeNeLux_2023_sponsorship_packages.pdf" download>Download our sponsor brochure</a>  

The **OWASP chapter meetings & Events** are the premier events worldwide and locally for IT and application and software security **technologists**, including CSOs, CISOs, CTOs, CIOs, DSOs, security architects, developers, network admins, application admins, MIS directors, government defense chiefs, and integrators.

These important inﬂuencers **drive buying decisions** for security purchases. OWASP provides sponsors with **exclusive access** to its audiences.

OWASP has established strategic relationships with many major media groups worldwide and in BeNeLux, focused on IT security—print publications, newsletters, portals, consultants, associations, and user groups. Your valuable message—and **leadership positioning**—reaches thousands of prospects before you even arrive at OWASP events.

OWASP’s mission is supported by a handful of security vendors and security organizations who share our **total customer** immersion approach to building relationships within the IT, application, and software security communities. This approach should be part of your overall marketing mix.

Don't be left in the cold! Sponsorships are limited and will fill up very rapidly. All proceeds from sponsorship support the mission of the OWASP Foundation (represented in Europe by OWASP Europe VZW, non-profit under Belgian Law). Supporting these events drives the funding for research grants, tools and documents, local chapters, and more.

## These combined sponsorship packages (Gold, Silver, or Bronze) cover the BE+NL chapter meetings 2023 and the BeNeLux OWASP Days 2023.

- Each year regular **chapter meetings** are organized by the **chapters**. High quality **speakers** are combined with **panel discussions**. OWASP chapters are attended by an average of 80 people. Our chapter meetings are communicated directly to **1500 contacts in Belgium, and the Netherlands** who are active in application security.

- In 2023 the **OWASP BeNeLux event** will be organized again on **Thursday 23 & Friday 24 November** in **Hasselt (BE)**. This edition will be hosted by **CORDA** in **Hasselt**. OWASP BE+NL 2023 is **two full days** of hands-on **OWASP Training and Conference** with a lineup of **local and internationally renowned speakers** covering OWASP and application security topics. In previous editions 200+ people attended the BeNeLux day hosted at the University of Leuven, the RAI in Amsterdam and the University of Luxem-bourg. For 2023 we are targeting **150+ attendees** from Belgium and The Netherlands.

- If we need to fall back on a virtual event, we will extend the sponsorship for one year towards including an in-person event.

Your sponsorship will be **invested directly** in the chapter meetings, supporting speaker and catering expenses. The sponsorship will also be dedicated to cover the costs of the OWASP 2023 BeNeLux event.
