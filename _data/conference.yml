  title   : Using WebAssembly to run, extend, and secure your application
  abstract: >-
            WebAssembly (WASM) has come a long way since its first release in 2017. 
            As a technology stack running inside the web browser, it even allows 
            products like Adobe Photoshop to run in that context. Now with a 
            standard called WASI, WASM is expanding beyond the browser to run in a 
            server-based context.<br />
            Had WASM and WASI been around in 2009, Docker would not have existed 
            according to one of its founders, Solomon Hykes. WASM has a strong 
            security posture given how it works with linear memory space and how 
            it supports a sandboxed-based environment called “nano-process”, 
            which uses a capabilities-based security model.<br />
            In this session we'll start out with going through some of the basic 
            security features of WASM and then move to running and extending an 
            application it with WASM. After that we'll focus on the security 
            features and use the sandbox and the capabilities based security 
            model to limit what it's allowed to do.

  bio     : >-
            Sarah-Jane is the Chief Information Security Officer of Sensing 
            Technology Group - a part of Fortive. She has over 20 years software 
            experience from the most formal environments to 'let's fix it in 
            production' type teams. She has been a longtime advocate of deliberate 
            application security as a partnership with product management and 
            believes that security does not have to be an overhead. A strong 
            proponent of threat modeling, she believes it is an essential practice 
            for every team driving towards the goal of secure by design.
  title   : Far from green fields - introducing Threat modelling to established teams
  abstract: >-
            'Far from green fields - introducing Threat modelling to established
            teams' takes a look at the unique challenges of introducing Threat
            Modelling to well established software teams.<br />
            Microsoft introduced threat modelling as part of the trustworthy
            computing initiative back in the early 2000s. This was in response to
            issues they were facing maintaining the trust of their user base in the
            light of several high profile security issues. Nobody would categorise
            Microsoft as a startup in 2002 and nobody at Microsoft was
            suggesting that they stop moving forward with planned features and
            advancements while they adjusted their practices. Why is it so that
            so much of the material available to support you as you roll out
            threat modelling describes it in the context of greenfield projects?
            Most of us need to know how to successfully introduce this highly
            effective shift-left security practice to real teams; teams that are
            running at pace on the tread mill of change, spinning the plates of
            customers commitments and feature enhancements.
            In this talk, I will share the experiences of a 3 year journey I have
            been on to introduce threat modelling to my colleagues across a
            range of product offerings. We made some mistakes, we learned
            some lessons the books could not have taught us but ultimately we
            succeeded and in succeeding we learned that introducing threat
            modelling is only the beginning.<br />
            Originally conceived in a pre-COVID world, this talk has been updated
            to include a look at the challenges and some surprising advantages
            of threat modelling on remote teams, the impact of legislation and the 
            pros and cons of AI for the practice.

  title   : OWASP Juice Shop - An Open Source Software (and security) Fairytale
  abstract: >-
            Once upon a time, developers and security experts relied on mostly server-side 
            rendered vulnerable applications to train their web hacking skills. In 2014 
            the Juice Shop entered the stage as one of the first Rich Internet Application 
            representatives. What started as a personal pet project with two dozen hacking 
            challenges, became an OWASP Flagship project shortly after and grew in size, 
            scope and use case coverage significantly over the years. Join Björn Kimminich 
            on a tour through the origins, history and evolution of OWASP Juice Shop from 
            2014 to 2023, closing with a peek into the future of this juicy hacking delicacy.

  name    : Frans van Buul
  bio     : >-
            Based out of the Netherlands, Frans van Buul is senior product manager for 
            Fortify SAST at OpenText. As such, he leads the further development of the 
            SAST product by a global team of developers and researchers. While it’s not 
            officially part of his job description, Frans loves to be hands-on and codes 
            a lot&#58; vulnerable code examples in a large variety of languages, Java 
            code with SAST analysis algorithms, and random stuff in his spare time. 
            Before transitioning into product management two years ago, Frans held several 
            other positions that provided him with the relevant background. He’s been a 
            security consultant and auditor at PwC, a Java developer and architect at 
            several companies, and a Fortify SAST sales engineer and sales engineering 
            leader.
  title   : Everything-as-Code&#58; Pushing the boundaries of SAST
  abstract: >-
            Static Application Security Testing (SAST) is the well-known practice of 
            analyzing a program's source code using automated techniques to detect potential 
            security problems. A key aspect of this is dataflow analysis, also known as 
            taint analysis. In this case, the SAST tool tries to find paths between entry 
            points of potential attacks, such as web request parameter, and program locations 
            where such an attack could manifest itself, such as non-escaped SQL statements.
            <br />
            While this is a tried-and-true approach for many important cases, such as Java 
            and C# web applications, it’s no longer enough as we’re entering the “everything 
            as code” era. As infrastructure becomes code (CloudFormation, Terraform, Bicep, 
            etc.), contracts become code (Solidity, Viper), circuits become code (VHDL, 
            Verilog), etc., all these things could potentially be analyzed using SAST 
            technology. SAST users are seeing this potential and are demanding SAST providers 
            to extend their offerings in this direction. However, doing so is not a 
            straightforward extension of standard SAST functionality into new languages and 
            libraries. 
            <br />
            In this talk, we’ll have a look at the frontier of SAST technology, looking at 
            two specific examples and their peculiarities&#amp; Bicep (Microsoft’s IaC language 
            for Azure), and Solidity (the most widely used language for smart contracts).

  title   : Secure defaults&#58; a scalable security approach for modern development
  abstract: >-
            Self-service security does not mean you let your developers fix all the security 
            bugs themselves. Nor does it mean only focusing on high-priority issues. 
            Fundamentally, the aim is to make it easy to write secure code and make it hard to 
            write insecure code. Instead of playing bug whack-a-mole, with secure defaults, we 
            build scalable solutions for repetitive tasks required by multiple teams. 
            These solutions are often called secure defaults, secure guardrails, or the paved road.
            <br />
            Once these building blocks are in place, the security team greatly reduces the time 
            spent on preventing these vulnerabilities in all phases of the development cycle. 
            Threat modeling, code reviewing, findings triaging, and bug bounty reviews; many of 
            these tasks become trivial and are reduced to boolean questions&#58; “Is the secure 
            default used or not?” 
            <br />
            In this talk, we will go over some of the fundamentals of why security teams must scale 
            and how this can be achieved with secure defaults. We will discuss some examples of 
            real companies like Netflix, Google, Semgrep, and Snowflake applying this approach. In 
            the second half of this presentation, I present practical tips and guidelines on how to 
            get started and which features in security tools can make the adoption of secure 
            defaults easier.
