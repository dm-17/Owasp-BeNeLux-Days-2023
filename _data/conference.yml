  title   : Down the Rabbit Hole&#58; Exploring GraphQL Exploitation
  abstract: >-
            "Down the Rabbit Hole: Exploring GraphQL Exploitation" is an 
            in-depth exploration into the world of GraphQL from a security 
            perspective. This talk is designed for those with a keen interest in 
            understanding the latest advancements in web technologies and their 
            potential vulnerabilities. It provides a roadmap to navigate the 
            complexities of GraphQL, demonstrating efficient methodologies for 
            building and consuming APIs while highlighting potential security 
            risks.<br />
            <br />
            The talk delves into the diverse ecosystem of tools, libraries, and 
            frameworks available across various programming languages, offering 
            real-time data updates through its subscription mechanism. It also 
            discusses the practical implementation and integration of GraphQL in 
            different environments, emphasizing potential security implications. 
            Whether you’re an experienced developer or a cybersecurity 
            professional, this talk will arm you with the necessary knowledge 
            and tools to effectively exploit and secure GraphQL implementations.

  title   : Using WebAssembly to run, extend, and secure your application
  abstract: >-
            WebAssembly (WASM) has come a long way since its first release in 2017. 
            As a technology stack running inside the web browser, it even allows 
            products like Adobe Photoshop to run in that context. Now with a 
            standard called WASI, WASM is expanding beyond the browser to run in a 
            server-based context.<br />
            Had WASM and WASI been around in 2009, Docker would not have existed 
            according to one of its founders, Solomon Hykes. WASM has a strong 
            security posture given how it works with linear memory space and how 
            it supports a sandboxed-based environment called “nano-process”, 
            which uses a capabilities-based security model.<br />
            In this session we'll start out with going through some of the basic 
            security features of WASM and then move to running and extending an 
            application it with WASM. After that we'll focus on the security 
            features and use the sandbox and the capabilities based security 
            model to limit what it's allowed to do.

            Sarah-Jane is the Chief Information Security Officer of Sensing 
            Technology Group - a part of Fortive. She has over 20 years software 
            experience from the most formal environments to 'let's fix it in 
            production' type teams. She has been a longtime advocate of deliberate 
            application security as a partnership with product management and 
            believes that security does not have to be an overhead. A strong 
            proponent of threat modeling, she believes it is an essential practice 
            for every team driving towards the goal of secure by design.
  title   : Far from green fields - introducing Threat modelling to established teams
  abstract: >-
            'Far from green fields - introducing Threat modelling to established
            teams' takes a look at the unique challenges of introducing Threat
            Modelling to well established software teams.<br />
            Microsoft introduced threat modelling as part of the trustworthy
            computing initiative back in the early 2000s. This was in response to
            issues they were facing maintaining the trust of their user base in the
            light of several high profile security issues. Nobody would categorise
            Microsoft as a startup in 2002 and nobody at Microsoft was
            suggesting that they stop moving forward with planned features and
            advancements while they adjusted their practices. Why is it so that
            so much of the material available to support you as you roll out
            threat modelling describes it in the context of greenfield projects?
            Most of us need to know how to successfully introduce this highly
            effective shift-left security practice to real teams; teams that are
            running at pace on the tread mill of change, spinning the plates of
            customers commitments and feature enhancements.
            In this talk, I will share the experiences of a 3 year journey I have
            been on to introduce threat modelling to my colleagues across a
            range of product offerings. We made some mistakes, we learned
            some lessons the books could not have taught us but ultimately we
            succeeded and in succeeding we learned that introducing threat
            modelling is only the beginning.<br />
            Originally conceived in a pre-COVID world, this talk has been updated
            to include a look at the challenges and some surprising advantages
            of threat modelling on remote teams, the impact of legislation and the 
            pros and cons of AI for the practice.
