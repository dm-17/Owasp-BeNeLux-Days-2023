   title   : Juice Shop Training&#58; Train the Trainer Edition
   abstract: >-
             In this training we will learn how to fully use the OWASP Juice 
             Shop in our own training courses, lectures or awareness sessions:<br />
             <br />
             * Intro: In this short module, we'll get to know the OWASP Juice Shop 
               and try out some hacking and coding challenges.<br />
             * Mob hacking: Here we get to know some challenges that are particularly 
               (un)suitable for hacking in the plenum.<br />
             * Theming: This module is all about customizing the Juice Shop to 
               transform it into the look and feel of your company and customers.<br />
             * CTF: In this module we will use Juice Shop and CTFd tools to set up a 
               Capture-the-Flag event in very short time with all Juice Shop hacking 
               challenges<br />
             * Integration: Finally, let's look at ways to integrate with learning 
               platforms, dashboards, etc., as well as the Juice Shop's anti-cheat 
               features.<br />
             <br />
             All modules are as little slides as possible and instead rich in practical 
             exercises and examples!<br />
             <br />
             Recuirements:<br />

   name    : Georges Bolssens
   bio     : >-
             Georges Bolssens embarked on his coding journey in the early 1990s and 
             delved into the realm of application security in 2017. With an inherent 
             passion for teaching, Georges is not only a seasoned developer but also an 
             adept communicator. His unique talent lies in simplifying intricate 
             subjects through relatable analogies, making him an engaging and effective 
             speaker.
             <br />
             Having undertaken numerous consulting assignments, Georges has assumed the 
             role of a cybersecurity educator for a diverse spectrum of professionals. 
             His guidance has illuminated the path for individuals ranging from legal 
             experts at renowned "Big 4" consulting firms to ethical hackers and all 
             those in between.
             <br />
             In his capacity as an Application Security Consultant at Toreon, Georges 
             has been instrumental in assisting numerous clients in constructing 
             comprehensive threat models for their digital assets.
   title   : Hands-on threat modeling workshop
   abstract: >-
             This training is a condensed version of the two-day training that Toreon 
             has been teaching at security conferences like BlackHat USA for several 
             years. It aims to introduce the fundamentals of threat modeling using the 
             DICE-framework (a.k.a. the "Four Question Framework") for threat modeling 
             a ficticious hotel booking application.<br />
             <br />
             This course is an entry-level introduction to threat modeling aimed at 
             anyone responsible for ensuring a product's security, be it software or 
             hardware, regardless of their prior expertise in security. We advocate 
             that threat modeling isn't just for the "happy few" but is essential 
             knowledge for all involved in the software development lifecycle. Typical 
             attendees of this course range from software developers, engineers, and 
             architects to product managers focused on security, incident responders, 
             and cybersecurity analysts or managers.<br />
             <br />
             Recruirements:<br />
             * A laptop with a browser is required for downloading the exercise PDFs 
             and taking notes. No software is required.
